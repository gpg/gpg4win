(To use S/MIME certificates for sign and encrypt, you have to define the trustability
of X.509 root certificates.)

A root certificate (root CA) is used to check the validity of all child certificates.
If you trust the root certificate therby you trust also all underlying certificates.

To avoid that each user must search and install the required root certificates, and
also check and authenticate the trustworthiness of the same, it is useful to install
a system-wide default of the most important root certificates:

1.  Store the root certificates

     Copy root certificate file to:
     [Windows 2000/XP]:
        C:\Documents and settings\All Users\Application data\GNU\etc\
        dirmngr\trusted-certs\
     [Windows Vista/7]:
        C:\ProgramData\GNU\etc\dirmngr\trusted-certs

     The corresponding root certificates must be available as files in DER
     format in the above file folder, with the file extension .crt or .der. 

     You get the root certificates from the respective CA administrators.
     CA operators often provide their root certificates also on websites
     for download.

     If the above folder is not visible? 
     Please read the reference note to the view options [1].

2.  Set ultimate trustable
 
     a) Open the following file with a text editor:
         [Windows 2000/XP]:
           C:\Documents and settings\All Users\Application data\GNU\etc\
           gnupg\trustlist.txt
         [Windows Vista/7]:
           C:\ProgramData\GNU\etc\gnupg\trustlist.txt

     b) Create a new line per root certificate with the corresponding fingerprint,
         such as:
         <FINGERABDRUCK> S 

         You get the fingerprint from the CA operators (often available
         from the website where you can download the root certificate). 
         Alternatively, you can get the fingerprint also via the command line tool
         "openssl" (not included in Gpg4win) from the root certificate file:
           openssl x509 -in <root-certificate> -noout -fingerprint -sha1
      
         A row that begins with # will be treated as a comment and ignored. 
         The end of the file must be followed by an empty row.

         Example of two entries with comments:
           # CN=Wurzel ZS 3,O=Intevation GmbH,C=DE
           A6935DD34EF3087973C706FC311AA2CCF733765B S

           # CN=PCA-1-Verwaltung-02/O=PKI-1-Verwaltung/C=DE
           DC:BD:69:25:48:BD:BB:7E:31:6E:BB:80:D3:00:80:35:D4:F8:A6:CD S
  
         In some cases it is useful to reduce the criteria for checking the root 
         certificate. To do this, you can set an additional flag relax after the S: 
         <FINGERPRINT> S relax

         Important: Using relax reduces the level of security, so it needs to be
         decided on a case-by-case basis and should only be used in the case of
         problems. 

3.  Complete Gpg4win installation and restart computer

     a) Enable the option "Root certificate defined or skip configuration".

     b) Complete the Gpg4win installation wizard regular.

     c) Restart your computer! (Required because the DirMngr have to read your root 
         certificates from (1).)

     Now, you have finished your S/MIME configuration successfully.

4.  Review later in Kleopatra: Import and check certificate chains

     Open Kleopatra and import your X.509 certificate chains. 
     The imported certificate chains should appear under the tab "Trusted
     Certificates". Gpg4win recognizes your imported root certificates as
     trustable.

     Problems? Kleopatra doesn't shows your root certificate as trustable?
     Solutions:
     * Click on the "Redisplay" button in Kleopatra to update the certificate view.
     * Add "relax" after the relevant root certificate in the trustlist.txt - see
        step (2).
